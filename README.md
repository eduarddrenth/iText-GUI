# iText-GUI
A JavaFX GUI supporting the Configurable-iText library

This GUI lets you import / create / modify stylesheets for iText. Also it lets you validate a Datamapping configuration you built
using your favorite xml editor. The GUI should give you a pretty good idea of what Configurable-iText can do for you.

With a stylesheet, datamapping and the implementation of 1 Java class you are able to generate reports almost without coding.
